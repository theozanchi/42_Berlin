SECTION 1 

THE TWO FACTORS OF A COMMODITY: 

USE-VALUE AND VALUE 

(THE SUBSTANCE OF VALUE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF VALUE) 



The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as "an 
immense accumulation of commodities," Â£1} its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must 
therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity. 

A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human 
wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the 
stomach or from fancy, makes no difference. [2} Neither are we here concerned to know how the object 
satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or indirectly as means of production. 

Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c, may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and 
quantity. It is an assemblage of many properties, and may therefore be of use in various ways. To 
discover the various uses of things is the work of history. [3] So also is the establishment of 
socially-recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of these 
measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, partly in convention. 

The utility of a thing makes it a use-value. [4] But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the 
physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such 
as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a use-value, something useful. 
This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful 
qualities. When treating of use-value, we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities, such as 
dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The use-values of commodities furnish the material for 
a special study, that of the commercial knowledge of commodities. [51 Use- values become a reality only 
by use or consumption: they also constitute the substance of all wealth, whatever may be the social form 
of that wealth. In the form of society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material 
depositories of exchange- value. 

Exchange-value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the proportion in which values 
in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, [6] a relation constantly changing with time 
and place. Hence exchange-value appears to be something accidental and purely relative, and 
consequently an intrinsic value, i.e., an exchange-value that is inseparably connected with, inherent in 
commodities, seems a contradiction in terms. [71 Let us consider the matter a little more closely.
